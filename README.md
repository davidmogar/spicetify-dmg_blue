## Installation instructions

This theme requires spicetify-cli. If it's not already installed, go to the [spicetify-cli](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli) repository and follow the installation steps.

Once done, clone the repository inside `~/.config/spicetify/Themes` and change `current_theme` on your `config.ini` file to `spicetify-dmg_blue` so it looks something like the following:

```
[Setting]
current_theme    = spicetify-dmg_blue
prefs_path       = /home/david/.config/spotify/prefs
...
spotify_path     = /opt/spotify
```
Finally, execute `spicetify update` on your terminal.

For more detailed instructions, check the oficial documentation for [spicetify-cli](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli).
